I used the default 'My name is Thomas and my main' and after making the finalStory and going through the summary, and making another story from that summary, I made this

"Thomas is the creator of the Kickstarter campaign to build a real-time gaming system. If you want to join his squad, or just want to share your ideas with your friends, he'll be there for you. Join our video series and be part of a conversation about how we can help the gaming industry change.


If you would like a special bonus to have a great time at the show, add your own Kickstarter!


A small $5 donation is enough to make the program available worldwide:
